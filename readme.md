### Ideas for improvement
- Add more cities to select and make fetching data for them
- Add emoji icons for weather conditions in the last column: ☀️ 🌤 🌦 🌧 🌩 🌨 ❄️️ 
- Elaborate on better styling and layout (optional, as this is a JS class)
- Fetch more/different data set/add another table
- [Advanced] Display loading state while fetching data
